  abstract={Automating code review activities poses significant demand as it takes a toll on the developers' valuable time and efforts. Accurate review comment and code refinement generation still remain quite a challenge due to their inherently diverse and non-unique nature. In this work, we prompt proprietary LLMs augmenting with semantic metadata and also fine-tune open-source LLMs in consumer machines to improve these two task automation. Both strategies improve the review generation performance, while function call graph augmented prompting on the GPT-3.5 model surpasses the current state-of-the-art pretrained model CodeReviewer by 90%+ BLEU in this task. Additionally, our prompted Gemini and fine-tuned Llama models achieve competitive performance in the code refinement generation task.<br><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382224024_Advancing_Automatic_Code_Review_and_Code_Refinement_Generation_Using_Large_Language_Models">Link</a>}

   Introduced a refined CD-MAWS method for phylogeny estimation, significantly reducing computational complexity from max(O(mn ), O(mn log n)) to max(O(mn ), O(mnk)) while maintaining tree quality, through a revised cosine distance calculation method, binary encoding of MAWs, and the adoption of suffix automata for MAW generation.
